# vita

This is a working version of my CV, originally forked from the design by [Kieran Healy](http://kieranhealy.org/) and incorporating edits and tweaks from [Paul Gessler](https://www.github.com/pdgessler).

### Instructions

The `Makefile` should already be setup to compile the `vita.tex`. From a command prompt, execute
    
    $ make cv
    $ make view

and the freshly-compiled file should be open in your default reader.
